\subsection[title={About me},reference={about-me}]

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, having realised a
lifelong passion for software development. I am passionate about Ruby
and Javascript with a thirst for discovering new languages and
frameworks.

With a background in Logistics & Supply Chain and having spent 7 years
planning worldwide tours for global artist management agencies, I have
developed a strong set of problem solving, collaborative and stakeholder
management skills.

I love programming as it gives me the freedom to create and innovate and
it offers the opportunity to push exciting new boundaries while
improving user experiences.

Throughout my career, I would always think of ways to improve our
processes while keeping abreast of innovations in the sector and I am
now particularly excited to be able to use my technical knowledge to
build solutions to help solve real world problems, whether in my
personal projects or in a workplace.

\subsubsubsection[title={Problem solving
üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è},reference={problem-solving}]

I always approach solving problems by breaking them down into manageable
chunks. I am {\bf patient} and never deterred by a problem.\crlf
A good example of this was deploying a finished product in just over a
week using entirely new technologies to us for my final project at
Makers - we came up against multiple challenges which we overcame by
mapping how each actor interacted, outlining the flow in the code,
narrowing down the issue, then each reading up on them and sharing what
we learned to inform our next sprint.\crlf
While working at MN2S, I led a team of 5 logistics coordinators in a
highly demanding environment, where we were constantly faced with
complex issues relating to artist tours. I taught the team to remain
{\bf calm} and worked with them to find the {\bf cleanest solution}.

\subsubsubsection[title={Stakeholder management
ü§ù},reference={stakeholder-management}]

Whilst working in artist management, I successfully managed high stakes
relationships with a variety of key stakeholders, including press and
legal teams, event promoters, artist managers and the artists
themselves, to ensure the success of worldwide tours and individual
shows.\crlf
This resulted in the band Boney M trusting me to tour manage them in
Thailand and DJ Jazzy Jeff's team agreeing to
\useURL[url1][https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-41051831][][reunite]\from[url1]
with Will Smith for a one-off show in Blackpool in 2017 which they
hadn't done in decades.

\subsubsubsection[title={Adaptable ‚òØÔ∏é},reference={adaptable}]

I always try to operate using a {\bf growth mindset}, by seeking out
criticism, changing my approach if I meet a difficult challenge and
gathering different perspectives This served me well when working on my
final group project at Makers as it meant I could quickly learn new
tools and motivate the team when we were struggling.\crlf
I pride myself on being {\bf empathic}, a good listener and have the
emotional intelligence to navigate through difficult situations. This
meant I could play an important role in keeping the project team on
track through {\bf positive leadership}.\crlf
While working in music, I often had to adapt my communication style to
build good relationships and explain complex concepts (e.g.~technical,
legal etc) to different audiences.

{\em \quotation{A web app for reviewers and students to book reviews and

In this final group project at Makers, I:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  Challenged myself by learning an entirely new stack which was not
  taught on the course and deployed in just over a week.
\item
  Wrote the frontend with {\bf Javascript/React} and {\bf Bootstrap} for
  extra styling
\item
  Wrote the backend in {\bf NodeJS/Express}
\item
  Hosted the database on {\bf AWS} via {\bf Heroku} and managed via
  {\bf PostgreSQL/Sequelize}
\item
  Used {\bf Bcrypt/Passport} for authentication,
\item
  Deployed via {\bf Heroku} with continuous integration via Travis-CI
\stopitemize

I particularly loved to:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  Work as part of a team and take ownership of features across backend
  and frontend
\item
  Gain the confidence to take a project from scoping requirements
  through to actual launch
\item
  Learn how to deploy a web app using the server to serve React's build
\item
  Showcase our project to a wider audience
  (\useURL[url3][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJvfMVrU9Vk][][presentation
  on YouTube]\from[url3]).
\stopitemize

Nice to have, if we had more time:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  Making the frontend more responsive
\item
  Fixing graphs rendering issues when passing props down from the
  Profile
\item
  Implementing Hash History as to avoid 404s on refresh or gracefully
  handle them with a catch-all.
\stopitemize

In this group project, we used:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  {\bf Ruby on Rails} for the backend
\item
  {\bf HTML/CSS} for the frontend
\item
  {\bf Devise} for Authentication and emails management
\item
  {\bf Capybara/RSpec} for TDD
\item
  Database management with {\bf PostgreSQL} and {\bf Google Cloud }for
  media files
\item
  Deployed via {\bf Heroku}.

{\em \quotation{A solo project and small test-driven program to interact

Here, I worked off acceptance criterias to create user stories and write
a program in Ruby / RSpec using BDD / best OOP practices.

{\em \quotation{A solo project to work with and refactor legacy code.}}

On this challenge, I had to add a new product to a legacy codebase that
has gone
\useURL[url7][https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/ruby/gilded_rose.rb][][out
of hand]\from[url7]. I started by writing
\useURL[url8][https://github.com/XavierDefontaine/Gilded-Rose-tech-test/blob/master/spec/gilded_rose_spec.rb][][tests

behaviour to be able to
\useURL[url9][https://github.com/XavierDefontaine/Gilded-Rose-tech-test/blob/master/lib/refactored_gilded_rose.rb][][refactor
and add the new product]\from[url9]. If I had more time then, I would
have looked at moving each item into respective classes using SRP and
dependency injection.
