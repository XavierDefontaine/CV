## About me

**Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a Junior role across Backend and/or Frontend.

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, having realised a lifelong passion for software development. I am passionate about Ruby and Javascript with a thirst for discovering new languages and frameworks. 

With a background in Logistics & Supply Chain and having spent 7 years planning worldwide tours for global artist management agencies, I have developed a strong set of problem solving, collaborative and stakeholder management skills.

I love programming as it gives me the freedom to create and innovate and it offers the opportunity to push exciting new boundaries while improving user experiences. I am now excited to be able to use my technical knowledge to build solutions to help solve real world problems, whether in my personal projects or in a workplace.

### Soft Skills 

#### Problem solving üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I always approach solving problems by breaking them down into manageable chunks. A good example of this was deploying a finished product in just over a week using entirely new technologies to us for my final project at Makers. During this project, we came up against multiple challenges which we overcame by mapping how each actor interacted, outlining the flow in the code, narrowing down the issue, then each reading up on them and sharing what we learned to inform our next sprint.

While working at MN2S, I led a team of 5 logistics coordinators in a highly demanding environment, where we were constantly faced with complex issues relating to artist tours. I taught the team to remain calm and worked with them to find the cleanest solution. In this role, I learned never to be deterred by a problem.

#### Stakeholder management ü§ù
Whilst working in artist management, I successfully managed high stakes relationships with a variety of key stakeholders, including press and legal teams, event promoters, artist managers and the artists themselves, to ensure the success of worldwide tours and individual shows. 

This resulted in the band Boney M trusting me to tour manage them in Thailand and DJ Jazzy Jeff‚Äôs team agreeing to [reunite](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-41051831) with Will Smith for a one-off show in Blackpool in 2017 which they hadn‚Äôt done in decades.  

#### Adaptable ‚òØÔ∏é
I always try to operate using a growth mindset, by seeking out criticism, changing my approach if I meet a difficult challenge and gathering different perspectives. This served me well when working on my final group project at Makers as it meant I could quickly learn new tools and motivate the team when we were struggling.

While working in music, I often had to adapt my communication style to build good relationships and to explain complex technical or legal requirements to different audiences. 
I always meticulously researched the music genre, product and industry I was working with to go above and beyond what was expected of me, for the artist and my company. 

#### Additional Skill 
Oh, and I also speak French fluently if that‚Äôs any use. üòÅ
