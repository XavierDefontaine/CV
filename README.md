## Interests
- **Music**: from playing classical/baroque music on the recorder as a kid to heavy metal as rythmn guitar in high school or obsessively listening to electronic music now, music has always been a passion of mine.
- **Restoration**: I love restoring mid-century furniture, gutting things around the house (computers, lamps etc) to see how they work and _sometimes_ fix them.
- **Growing**: sowing seeds, watching it grow chopping its plants, and experimenting 
- **Challenging**: I am fascinated by concepts totally alien to me especially those around the tech community whether philosophical (e.g [Lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)'s rationalism & AI) or more technical (e.g Hacker News) often leading me down rabbits holes for hours on end.
