I am a **Full Stack Junior Developer** looking for a Junior role across Backend and/or Frontend.

I am passionate about Ruby and Javascript with a thirst for learning new languages and frameworks.

With a background in Logistics & Supply Chain and having spent 7 years planning worldwide tours for global artist management agencies,  I have developed a strong  set of problem solving, collaborative and stakeholder management skills. I am my most energised when working with a diverse team to achieve a common goal, and really enjoy sharing knowledge as well as learning from those around me.

I have recently graduated from Makers Academy, having realised a lifelong passion for software development, and am eager to start a new career.  My time at the bootcamp taught me the value of a growth mindset which is a principle I apply to all my learning and development.

Coding to me is the freedom to create and innovate, it offers the opportunity to push exciting new boundaries and continually improve user experiences.  I am also excited to now have the technical skills and the perspective to be able to build solutions to help solve real world problems using TDD, Agile and best practices.

## Interests
- **Music**: from playing classical/baroque music on the recorder as a kid to heavy metal as rhythm guitar in high school or obsessively listening to electronic music now, music has always been a passion of mine.
- **Restoration**: I love restoring mid-century furniture, gutting things around the house to see how they work and _sometimes_ fix them.
- **Challenging**: I am fascinated by concepts totally alien to me especially those around the tech community whether philosophical (e.g [Lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)'s rationalism & AI) or more technical (e.g Hacker News) often leading me down rabbits holes for hours on end.
